# Images Directory

This directory is intended for storing logo and other image assets for the website.

## Note on Logo
The problem statement mentioned adding a logo image, but no actual image file was provided in the requirements. The website currently uses an SVG placeholder logo that has been updated to match the new blue color scheme.

To add a custom logo image:
1. Place the logo file (e.g., `logo.png`) in this directory
2. Update the logo section in `index.html` to reference the image:
   ```html
   <div class="logo">
       <img src="images/logo.png" alt="Centro Cultural do Monte de Vez">
   </div>
   ```
